The primary goal of this project is predictive, focusing on developing a reliable classification model that can distinguish between malignant and benign breast tumors. Although interpretability is also valuable—understanding which cell features most strongly correlate with malignancy—the immediate objective is to predict tumor status accurately for early medical intervention. From a healthcare or clinical standpoint, an accurate predictive model for breast cancer diagnosis provides significant benefits:

Timely Detection: Early detection of malignant tumors can dramatically improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.

Resource Allocation: Hospitals and clinics can prioritize high-risk patients for more thorough medical examinations and follow-up procedures, optimizing limited resources.

Clinical Decision Support: Oncologists and medical professionals gain a data-driven tool that complements traditional diagnostic methods (e.g., imaging, biopsy) and enhances patient care.
